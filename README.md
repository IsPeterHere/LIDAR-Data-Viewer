# LIDAR-Data-Viewer

This is a collection of lidar data scripts that have been used to visulize the exellent lidar data sets provided by <a href = "https://remotesensingdata.gov.scot/data#/list">ScotGov</a> covering a fair portion of scotland.

## Tap O'Noth
Bellow is our rendering of the data from phase 2 covering Tap O' Noth. The goal was to have an image where each point we colour each point based on its diffrnece the gradient of the surrrounding points, this results in a final image that better highlights small fetures. As far as colouring methedology, blue indicates an 'expected gradient' while red/green corresponds to a raised/sunken gradient.

This can be compared to the <a href="https://maps.nls.uk/geo/explore/#zoom=17.2&lat=57.35151&lon=-2.85875&layers=LIDAR_1m_dtm2&b=ESRIWorld&o=100">National Library's normal map</a> and also the excellent production from <a href="https://www.facebook.com/northarchaeo/posts/fabulous-lidar-image-of-tap-o-noth-hillfort-in-aberdeenshire-surrounded-by-trace/1780569298750900/">James O'Driscoll Aberdeen</a>.


## Lyne Fort

A Small Roman Fort, built some point during the Antonine reoccupation of Scotland. Proccesed with similar methedology to Tap O'Noth except a grayscale colouring was used with dark indicating raised and light indicating sunken, the data is relativly noisy with many recent plow marks very visable but also many more intresting details of the fort can be seen. The largely flattened inner wall is very visable as a dark ring and many of the exterior parts to the fort can also be seen as lighter markings.
